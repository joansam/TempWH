-- Planned changes:
-- Decrease cost of autocosted sorcerer line
-- FIX AVATAR DESC

-- Look at commanders' stats, specifically HP, Prot/Invuln, Attacks (including Daemons)
-- Keep working on modelling Marks and Gifts of Slaanesh
-- Look at combat spells, consider adding Cacaphonic Choir, consider making the best W/D crosspath
-- Also look at items again, now that magic is so different.
-- Remove some attacks from monsters with newly doubled Slaaneshi Claws
-- Look at gods, esp. human form of Avatar
-- Consider adding chaos power...look at pros and cons w/magic power.
-- Consider sacredness of base sorcerer

--CHANGES STAGING
--Daemon tentacle added, is magic and used by spawn and slaanesh avatar

--Version 1.00 - Finished Changes:
-- For more specific info, use the mod inspector. This is more of an explanation of the current faction.
-- (Basically every unit has been changed in some way.)


-- Magic changes overview:
-- Blood magic scales with priest level, to make explicit the connection between Daemons/Gifts and worship.
-- Human magic focuses on Water, Air, Fire, in no order.
-- Daemon magic focuses on Water, Death, Astral, in that order - the daemons are closer to 'true' magic.
-- Exalted Champion and Lord no longer have magic
-- Custom blessings removed; they were a silly workaround. Sorcerers and daemons now have priest levels.
-- Reintroduced cultist as B1H1, removed sorc's B1H1 and gave them S1 for ease of micro. Added flavor text.

-- New unit: Exalted Daemon, with other Slaanesh mod Chaos Lord sprite and, new summon spell.
-- The Exalted Daemon is a priest lvl 2 with inquisitor and stealthy. She has some minor magic, and can summon 1 Daemonette/turn.
-- Cultist removed for now (in unit and in rec list), could add later if necessary. Should give them blood if they come back in though.
-- Lots of description changes
-- Most commanders moved to autocost
-- Champion, Exalted Champion, Lord no longer have the magic item Chaos Armor, they now have the equipment. Actually, since it's magic armor you might want to do something about it.
-- Scythetalons no longer AP but have 2 attacks, debatable though.
-- Aura of Slaanesh was broken, now does 33 stun damage instead of 5. Also now AoE1; it's an Aura in WH, not actually a weapon.
-- Daemon-Forged broadswords and morningstars used by Chosen and Champions are now much more in line with WH stats. They have 2 attacks, and are not magic or AP. They are now named Chaos broadsword and morningstar. All units have been updated accordingly.
-- Slaanesh Chaos Armor prot 17 -> 18, def penalty 2 -> 1.
-- Sigvald the Magnificent: His sword, Sliverslash, now gets 6 attacks, from 2. Awe 3 -> 6. Added base prot 15 - otherwise headshots are brutal. No longer immortal.
-- Sprite of Herald changed to Amazonian Chosen - used for Exalted Champion in the other Slaanesh mod. Also changed stealth 20 -> 60, added inquisitor tag (is priest 2). Can summon dameonettes.
-- All summon spells changed from Conjuration to Blood, path req often lowered by 1, pathreqs trimmed and number of 'gems' required multiplied by 3 for blood slaves(standard stuff).
-- Added an extra attack to fiends, fiends now summon 4 instead of 2...seemed underpowered
-- Keeper of Secrets hugely improved - all-around better stats, gifted with high Awe, regen, recup, and has 1d6 fiends in battle, among more typical changes.
-- Items and armors changed to appropriate paths
